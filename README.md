# AIBathy: Recovering Bathymetry from Satellite Altimetry-derived Gravity by Fully Connected Deep Neural Network (FC-DNN)

Welcome to the AIBathy project! This project uses deep learning techniques to predict ocean bathymetry. 

## Paper

We have submitted a paper detailing the methods and results of this project to a scientific journal. The paper is currently under review. We will update this section with the citation details once the paper is published.

## Code

The code for this project is available in this repository. It includes all the scripts and data files necessary to reproduce our results. We have also included detailed comments in the code to explain how it works.

## Usage

To use this code, you will need to have Python and several Python libraries installed, including TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib. You can run the code on any system that supports Python.
